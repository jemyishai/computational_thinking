Computational thinking is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science, and expressing solutions to those problems so that they can be run on a computer. Computational thinking involves breaking down a problem in smaller parts, looking for patterns in those subproblems, figuring out what information is needed, and developing a step-by-step solution.

Computational thinking is part of a problem solving process that ends with writing a program.

		1. Decomposition takes a complex problem and breaks it into more manageable sub-problems. 
		2. By solving each potentially simpler sub-problem, we can put the solutions together to arrive at a solution to the original complex problem.
